Introduction
Linux is a very famous, open-source operating system. Many developers use Linux for development purposes because of its high throughput. As a student or even a professional in the software industry, it is very essential to have knowledge of the Linux OS. Many programmers prefer Linux over Windows OS for development purposes due to a variety of reasons such as the security of the Linux Operating System is better than Windows, the Linux terminal is way superior to the windows command line in many ways, etc.

What is Linux and Why use it?

Before we jump into studying a lot of Linux commands, it is very important to address this question What is Linux and why is it preferred over Windows OS. Linux is an open-source operating system whose source code is available for modification and commercial and non-commercial distribution under the guidelines of the GNU General Public License.

Linux has a number of advantages over the Windows operating system and is used widely because of these advantages Below are a few listed:

The major advantage of the Linux Operating System is that it is a freely available open-source OS. This means that the source code of the Linux Operating System is available openly in the market (on the internet) and anyone can study it, modify it and even send it forward for commercial uses too. However, the major use case of it being an Open Source OS is the study of the Operating System itself. If anyone has to understand the Operating System as a core subject, it's working, and what are the things kept in mind while designing an operating system, you can simply look up the code of Linux OS and get a plethora of ideas.
Privacy and Security are very important for the users, especially nowadays, when hacking and other cyber malpractices have become so common. Linux maintains the privacy of the user and is a lot more secure than Windows OS. However, this does not mean that Linux is completely secured and can never be attacked. This simply means that it is more secure than Windows and it does not even require any antivirus software to be installed within it.
Linux Operating System is highly stable and does not hang or requires to be restarted again and again.
Linux is fast and easy to install and can be installed very easily from the internet.
Linux is network friendly.
So, now that we have a fair idea about the Linux Operating System and its advantages over the Windows OS, let us now move on to the Linux Cheat Sheet and study the Linux Commands.
